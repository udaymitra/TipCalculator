Notes:

I coded this app in Objective-C.
I will take a stab at writing tip calculator app in swift in a different project.

In my application I accidentally used my work github user name (umantripragada).
Please use this github user name (udaymitra) for my application (email:udaymitra4u@gmail.com).
